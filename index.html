            SEO Hacker is known for SEO in the Philippines.
             We have been doing SEO as a full-service agency for 
             clients who want their websites to rank here and abroad. 
             It's quite common for someone to search for SEO Philippines 
             and see the list of first page results and proceed to contact 
             the SEO companies listed there for a quote or a presentation. 
             We are aware of this and it is one reason why it is a keyword 
             that we put a ton of effort to rank for.

        <h2>Why SEO Hacker is the SEO company of choice
             for SEO in the Philippines

            <li>
                <p>
                    The best reason why we are one of the SEO agencies that 
                    is always picked to pitch or present is our reputation 
                    of using white hat, all-ethical SEO that lasts for years. 
                    We make sure that our partners who choose us for their 
                    SEO are able to generate revenue from the rankings we 
                    achieve for their website.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Our SEO process is fully transparent to our partners. 
                    We report to them 100% of the things we do—from the 
                    on-page optimizations to where we get each and every 
                    link that we build for them. This way, they know we 
                    aren’t messing up their website or using any black or 
                    gray hat tactics.

                    SEO Hacker is the most sought-after SEO agency in the 
                    Philippines because we understand what it takes to rank 
                    our partners in the search engines—and how to keep them 
                    there. SEO is a long game and it does take time to rank 
                    on the first page of Google. Our clients usually see 
                    fluctuations in their keyword rankings by the third 
                    month and we often secure first page rankings by the 
                    8th to the 12th month.

                    SEO takes a long time especially because companies 
                    here in the Philippines may have numerous different 
                    suppliers for their web hosting, web design, site security, 
                    and other web properties. All these digital assets have to 
                    work together with the SEO agency to have good, steady, and 
                    incremental rankings that lasts.

            SEO Hacker came to be known as one of the foremost authorities of 
            SEO in the Philippines because of the SEO Hacker blog. We write 
            about SEO strategies, SEO tactics, SEO news, updates and Google 
            algorithm changes—which people all over the world read. We have 
            over 40,000 readers each month and tons of subscribers that 
            receive our email newsletter whenever we publish something new.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have been working hard in creating new free resources for 
            digital marketers, SEO beginners, and even business owners as 
            well. We believe in giving value to our community.

            SEO in the Philippines is also a young industry. When I started 
            practicing as an SEO specialist back in 2009 is really when SEO 
            just started to pick up in this country. But more and more 
            companies in the Philippines are realizing how important SEO 
            is for their websites. If you haven’t yet, you can check our SEO 
            Services page to learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our blog is also widely read by Filipinos—making them our 5th 
            highest reader count in the world. That tells me there are more 
            Filipinos who are getting into the world of SEO and leveling 
            themselves up as SEO specialists. Perhaps this is because of the 
            wake of the pandemic and FIlipinos had a lot of time to learn SEO 
            and upskill themselves during the government lockdown.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have been featured as well in numerous SEO websites, news, 
            and podcasts due to our expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
            SEO in the Philippines is now a booming industry, and I’m glad 
            to find and meet a lot of other Filipinos now who are practicing 
            SEO and providing service around the world.

                <p>
                    According to Statista, internet user penetration rate 
                    is at 72.7% in 2021. And English is our second national 
                    language. That means a lot of Filipinos know their way 
                    around the internet and have a Native/Bilingual grasp of 
                    the English language. Those two attributes strongly qualify 
                    us to have good reason and interest in web traffic 
                    generation. A lot of Filipinos are also outspoken and 
                    have their own blogs —which also need traffic.

                <h3>Filipinos are creative</h3>
                <p>
                    Filipinos are also a creative people, which is necessary 
                    for SEO and other digital marketing strategies. We love 
                    stories, which translate into top-notch writing. We love 
                    making art, which translates to aesthetic websites that are 
                    pleasing to users—and to search engines.
                </p>

                    Filipinos own their work
                </h3>
                <p>
                    SEO is also one of the most in-demand jobs on the internet 
                    to date. And it has created a lot of job opportunities for 
                    Filipinos who are looking for employment but don’t want to 
                    be ‘just another’ employee. With SEO, we get to unleash our 
                    creativity, and we get to own projects and see them from 
                    start to finish—work that is certainly fulfilling for people 
                    who enjoy growth and ownership.
